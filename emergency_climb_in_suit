doc code:

g:
fireproof
bulletproof
should take a special saw to cut it.
should have pretty much all the same powers as the iron man suit

battery life goal:

=================================================
in use:
something like a fire breaks out at home

0. user climbs into the suit, and they suit takes them to safety
1. also sends an alert and video chat to the person's emergency contacts
2. emergency contact should be able to remote control the suit from across the world too
=======================================
sounds like emergency protocols should be preprogrammed? fire always take the user to building#72?
